<h1>Lab 1 All Wired Up</h1>
<p>
  Course: ATLS 3300<br>
  Student: Sammy Muroff<br>
  Assignment: Simple Circuits, LEDs, and Resistors
</p>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>
  The goal of this lab was to learn the basics of electrical circuits. To achieve this we built simple
  LED circuits using a breadboard. Through this lab, I explored how voltage, current, and
  resistance relate to one another, how polarity affects LEDs, and how switches can be
  used to control the flow of electricity in circuits.
</p>

<h2>Materials Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>ELEGOO Arduino Uno Starter Kit</li>
  <li>830 tie-point breadboard</li>
  <li>Power supply module (3.3V / 5V)</li>
  <li>9V battery with barrel jack connector</li>
  <li>LEDs</li>
  <li>Resistors (100Ω and others)</li>
  <li>Push button</li>
  <li>Breadboard jumper wires</li>
  <li>Multimeter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Part 1: Setting up Power</h2>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>
  Connect the power supply module to the breadboard, make sure that the positive
  and negative pins aligned correctly with the breadboard power rails. Then connect the
  9V battery to the barrel jack on the module and turn the module on to supply power
  to the board. Make that you are using the 3.3V side of the power supply.
</p>

<h3>Voltage Measurement</h3>
<p>
  Using a multimeter set to measure DC voltage, test both power rails on the
  breadboard. One side should measure 3.3V and the other side
  approximately 5V. This confirms that the power supply module is functioning correctly.

<h2>Part 2: NOT Blowing up an LED</h2>

<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>
  LEDs must be protected from excessive current at all times. Connecting an LED directly to a power
  source can cause too much current to flow, which can damage or destroy the LED.
  A resistor is used in series with the LED to limit current.
</p>

<h3>Mathematical Calculations</h3>
<p>
  Ohm's Law was used to calculate the required resistance:
</p>
<p>
  R = V / I
</p>

<p>
  For a 3.3V power source and a target current of 30 mA:
</p>
<p>
  R = 3.3V / 0.03A = 110Ω
</p>

<p>
  Since a 110Ω resistor was not available, a 100Ω resistor will do. This results in a
  current of approximately 33 mA, which is within the safe operating range of the LED.
</p>

<h3>5V Circuit Calculation</h3>
<p>
  For a 5V power source:
</p>
<p>
  R = 5V / 0.03A ≈ 167Ω
</p>

<p>
  Since a 167Ω resistor was not available, a 220Ω resistor will do. This results in a
  current of approximately 33 mA, which is within the safe operating range of the LED.

<h2>Part 3: Switching the LED</h2>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>
  Add a push button to the LED circuit so that the LED will only turn on when the
  button was pressed. The push button acts as a momentary SPST switch, completing
  the circuit only while it is being pressed.

<h2>Extra Volt</h2>
<p>
  To create a ircuits LED is on by default and turns off when the push button is pressed
  a path of less resistance around the led needs to be created. This circuit demonstrates a
  logical NOT operation, since pressing the button inverts the state of the LED.

<h2>Problems Faced and Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  One issue I encountered was wiring the LED backwards, which prevented it from
  lighting. Fixing the polarity resolved the issue. Using the multimeter helped confirm
  that the correct voltages were being supplied throughout the circuit.
</p>
<p>
  This lab provided a strong introduction to basic electronics and circuit design. The
  concepts learned here will be important for future labs involving more complex
  components and systems.
